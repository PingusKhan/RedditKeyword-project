# RedditKeyword-project
< Saturday, November 17 2018 >

-The project shows a webpage displaying a search bar where the user can input any subreddit tag they want. After the user submits his or her search, the webpage displays the top 10 articles and the top 10 most popular used keywords mentioned in the subreddit tag.

# Inspiration
-Our idea was inspired from the first workshop that was offered at the HACKUCI mini hackathon. We liked what the Reddit API and Flask had to offer, so we wanted to create a program that allowed us to apply these tools.

# Languages Used
-Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, Praw, Jinja

# Tutorial
-In order to run the project, one must download or clone the files. Open the files with Visual Studio Code and on a new terminal in the application, type "python3 app.py" which runs the app.py program. 

-Make sure python version 3 is installed.
